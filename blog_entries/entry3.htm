<h3>jQuery Experiments</h3>

<p>
    Week 3 was spent learning the most popular library available for web UI - jQuery. The APIs were found to be easy to use and the documentation available on the web was extensive. 
    Apart from the goodness of the core library, the jQuery-UI extension provides a rich set of UI controls which are very useful and easy to code with jQuery.
    My experiments are as follows.

<ol>
    <li>
        jQueryUi - Drag and Drop
    </li>
    <li>
        jQueryUi - Sortable elements
    </li>
    <li>
        jQuery effect() method
    </li>
    <li>
        jQuery animate() method
    </li>
    <li>
        jQuery slideshow
    </li>
</ol>
