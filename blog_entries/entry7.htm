<h3>Node.JS experiments</h3>

<p>
    MongoDB was very different compared to relational DB like MySQL. The concept of no structure was new and thus there was some difficulty initially.
    But the ease of use became apparent along with the progress of experiments. Usage of mongoose along with MongoDB was very easy and provision of asynchronous calls is a huge feature in itself.
