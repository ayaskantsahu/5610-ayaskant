<h3>Project based experiments</h3>

<p>
    Finally its project time!! Time to integrate all the technologies i have learnt. Am trying to build a responsibility allocation tool for snell library help desk staff. I will be using HTML 5, CSS 3, Angular JS, Passport JS, Express Js, Mongoose, MongoDB and node-rest-client

<ol>
    <li>
        I started the project by making a design which will make the website look nice. Used bootstrapto ensure that it is responsive.
    </li>
    <li>
        I decided upon the data model and databse schema after that. used mongoose to create the data model on nodejs.
    </li>
    <li>
        The various routes were created for frontend routing on angular js
    </li>
    <li>
        Using node-rest-client and express.js, I was able to call the webservice and provide data to the browser. UI is pending for this.
    </li>
    <li>
        I was able to write a logic to search JSON data for a specific staff and return a list of all possible matches to the browser. The UI is pending.
