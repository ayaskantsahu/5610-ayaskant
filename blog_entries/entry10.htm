<h3>Project based experiments - part 2</h3>

<p>
   After setting up the basic infrastructure, I made some progress in building the features. I started making basic UI on top of services created previous week. Though these features are not polished yet, they are minimally functional and usable at this point of time.

<ol>
    <li>
        Added feature of assigning roles to staff on a specific shift. The data was fetched from 3rd party API call.
    </li>
    <li>
        The feature of dispaying these data from 3rd party API to help user assign a role to a specific staff was implemented.
    </li>
    <li>
        The assigned role is then saved into MongoDB for further analysis. Mongoose ODM was used for the same.
    </li>
    <li>
        Feature of searching user based on their partial names was implemented. This bootstrap-anguar plugin was very easy to use, thanks to the documentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Previously built authentication was integrated into the project. Log out feature is still pending.
    </li>
    
</ol>
