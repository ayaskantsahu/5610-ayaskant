<h3>AngularJS experiments</h3>

<p>
    AngularJS has come across a very different framework. Unlike jquery which was a library, angular has its own patterns and rules which a developer must understand and use. This took significant time to understand and implement
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Data binding with angularJS - This included implementation of tables with angular JS as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        Search using AngularJS filters
    </li>
    <li>
        Search using $http and JSON response.
    </li>
    <li>

<h3>jQuery Experiments</h3>

<p>
    Week 3 was spent learning the most popular library available for web UI - jQuery. The APIs were found to be easy to use and the documentation available on the web was extensive. 
    Apart from the goodness of the core library, the jQuery-UI extension provides a rich set of UI controls which are very useful and easy to code with jQuery.
    My experiments are as follows.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        jQueryUi - Drag and Drop
    </li>
    <li>
        jQueryUi - Sortable elements
    </li>
    <li>
        jQuery effect() method
    </li>
    <li>
        jQuery animate() method
    </li>
    <li>
        jQuery slideshow
    </li>
</ol></div>
