        Hello, Welcome to my project Infocommons Scheduler. Infocommons is the team of Snell library which handles all the IT related support. The staff is responsible for maintaining all computers, printers and aother IT stuff. They currently use WhenIWork.com for their time and attendance system. WhenIWork allows schedules to be uploaded and student staff will be notified of the same. WhenIWork exposes Developer API to users who can query for data like shifts and the perople who are allocated to these shifts.
        <b><em>This project will be used in real time as the requirements were specified by my supervisor at Infocommons.</em></b>

        <h2 class="text-center">Requirement</h2>
        Students are assigned different roles like Printers, Help Desk, Floater or Digital Media Commons. CUrrently this is done manually. There was a requirement of automating this process so they can track who has been assigned which role in the past and thus make decisions based on it. One such decision is to assign roles for current shift as everyone should get a fair share of each role.
